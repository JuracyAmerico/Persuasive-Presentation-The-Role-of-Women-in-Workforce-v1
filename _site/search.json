This isn’t just about equal pay, this is about a deeply rooted issue of gender inequality that affects us all.\nWhile Canadian women have made incredible strides in workforce participation since the mid-20th century, systemic barriers continue to hold them back. My goal today is to persuade you that achieving true gender equality in Canada requires a multifaceted approach to address these deeply ingrained issues and unlock the full potential of our workforce."

Data shown are for employees between the age of 25 and 54 [Infographic]. From Canada’s gender wage gap narrows: Women earn $4.13 less than men per hour - national | globalnews.ca. (2019). https://globalnews.ca/news/6001276/gender-wage-gap-women-canada/ ©Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada, as represented by the Minister of Industry, 2019.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe gender pay gap is the difference between what men and women earn for similar work. Despite progress, in 2018, Canadian women earned a shocking 13.3% less per hour than men. Think about that — for every dollar a man earns, a woman doing the same job earns only 87 cents.\nWhy? A major factor is occupational segregation, meaning women are often concentrated in lower-paying fields. This isn’t accidental. There’s a clear devaluation of work traditionally done by women. Research shows that when more women enter a field, the average salary for that profession actually goes down! For every 10% increase in women in a specialty, the median salary drops by over $8,000. This points to a deep-rooted bias we need to challenge."

Despite their qualifications, women are significantly underrepresented in leadership positions. Yet, studies show that companies led by women actually outperform others, demonstrating that diverse leadership isn’t just ethical, it’s good for business.\nSo, what’s holding women back? Unconscious bias plays a big role. This can be as subtle as assuming a man is more assertive or a woman is less likely to take risks. This bias affects hiring, promotions, and even who gets mentored for leadership roles."

Women disproportionately shoulder the burden of housework and childcare. Even when both partners work full-time, studies show women are still doing the lion’s share at home.\nThis unequal division has a ripple effect. It limits women’s career progression, forcing many to reduce their hours or leave the workforce entirely. This contributes to the “motherhood penalty,” where mothers face significant career setbacks compared to fathers.\nNow, some might argue against these points. They might say addressing these issues is costly or that women aren’t as ambitious. Let’s examine these arguments."

Studies show investing in affordable childcare boosts the economy by increasing productivity and allowing more women to work.\nAnother argument relies on harmful stereotypes, suggesting women are less ambitious or lack leadership qualities. This simply isn’t true. Research consistently debunks this myth, showing women are just as interested in leadership roles but face greater obstacles throughout their careers."
